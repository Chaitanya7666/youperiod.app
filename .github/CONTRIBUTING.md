# Contributing to youperiod.app

We enthusiastically welcome contributors. All contributors are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/getify/youperiod.app/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in their engagement with this project, and all contributions will be open sourced under [our project license](https://github.com/getify/youperiod.app/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

## How to contribute

- Please search existing (open and closed!) Issues, PRs, and Discussions to check to see if the changes you're making have already had prior discussion
- Please review the implied code styles (whether that be HTML, CSS, or JS) for the surrounding code, and make your best attempts to adhere to that code style with the code you submit. We are not using any code formatters or linters or other automatic enforcement, but will work out any consistency efforts during each PR code review.
- Open a pull request with your changes
  - Please title your PR related to what you're doing and use the description field to describe your changes
- A maintainer will review, request changes (as needed), and be responsible for merging

_If you have project questions like about "why is the app client-side only?" or "why not use a framework like Vue [etc]", please refer to the [technical philosophy for the project documented in Discussions](https://github.com/getify/youperiod.app/discussions/36)_
